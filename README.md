# Mapping Earthquakes & Tectonic Plates
## *A Stylized Leaflet Visualization*
As a Data Visualization Specialist at the Disaster Reporting Network, I was tasked with gathering data for Basil and his team of reporters and Data Visualization experts. They are looking for a desktop and mobile interactive earthquake map to easily identify where seismic activity is taking place and the magnitude thereof. By adding tectonic plates to the map, they are able to identify relationships and causation for some of the more consistent and larger occurrences as well.

The data here was taken from the USGS website that maps coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. With Leaflet, javascript, and html, up-to-date and easy-to-read earthquake activity is readily available for anyone who wants to view it!
